Project Overview:
My project creates a space colonization simulation that models the early stages 
of human expansion across multiple planets such as Mars, Luna, Europa, and Titan. 
The program shows how each colony changes over time as populations grow or shrink, 
resources are consumed or produced, and new structures are built. The simulation 
advances in fixed time steps (“years”) and demonstrates how different colonies 
develop under changing conditions.

Implementation:
The project uses a std::map to store and manage the state of each colony.
  The map key represents the planet name (e.g., "Mars").
  The map value is an std::array of three std::lists, which store:
    Colonists (names/roles)
    Resources (materials, oxygen, fuel, etc.)
    Structures (habitats, labs, reactors)


All starting data is loaded from an external file (data.txt) 
with at least 100 lines in the format:
Planet | Category | Item
where Category is one of {colonist, resource, structure}.

Each map entry represents the full state of a single colony, 
and the simulation updates this state over time.

Simulated Events:
The simulation models three main types of changes each year:
  Population change – A new recruit may arrive, or a colonist may transfer to another planet.

  Resource change – Resources may be produced, consumed, or lost.

  Construction change – A new structure may be built, or an old structure may be decommissioned.

Each of these events happens at discrete time steps, making this a discrete-event simulation 
rather than a continuous model. The program begins by displaying the initial colony data, 
then runs for 30 simulated years (meeting the 25+ requirement), 
printing a short summary of changes after each year, and finally showing the updated final state.
