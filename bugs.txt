1.Uniidentified vector
    add include<vector>

2.else if (actR == 1 && !triple[0].empty()) 
            triple[0].pop_back();
            dR--;
(accidently use triple [0] instead of triple[1] making them not showing the correct output) 
    change from triple[0] to triple[1]

3.decide to not use <vector> in the code so it was taken out.

4.int id = 1 and int rid =1 rest to 1 
    c change them to static to make them not change

5.wrong label pushed "recruit-" into resources part
    change it to resourcePack

6.removing from an empty list would crash
    create a net with !triple[i].empty()

7.Program will still run without data if file open failed
    Ifstream check; print error and return 1 when data.txt missing.

8.weird output misalignment because no format
    now with iomanip makes it more readable

9.Comment clarity on deltas
    int dC = 0, dR = 0, dS = 0;
    the d were looking like it wassn't obviouse what they are so I added a comment on it

10.Copied the colonist block ro resource block and forgot to change them so it output the wrong data
    I change thme back to their correct one
